                        <h3>Geographical location</h3>
                        <p>The republic of Uganda is a landlocked country found in the heart of East Africa. The current
                            president is H.E. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of the National Resistence Movememt (NRM) political
                            party.
                            Its capital city is Kampala, which is beautifully depicted in the images above. Uganda is
                            neighboured by Kenya to the East, Tanzania to the south, it is south of South Sudan and East
                            of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

                        <h3>The People</h3>
                        <p>According to Historians and Ugandan websites like visit Uganda, the earliest human
                            inhabitants in Uganda were hunter gatherers.
                            Remnants of these people are today found to be among the pygmies in western Uganda.
                            Approximately 1500 to 2000 years ago, Bantu speaking populations
                            from central and western Africa migrated and occupied most of the southern parts of the
                            country. The migrants brought with them agriculture, ironworking skills and new ideas
                            of social and political organization, that by the 15th-16th century, resulted in the
                            development of centralized kingdoms, including the
                            kingdom of Buganda, Bunyoro, kitara and Ankole.
                        </p>
                        <p>Today, Uganda is made of diverse cultures and tribes all living together harmoniously. The
                            Ugandan people and East African people in general
                            are known to be very hospitable.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Economic Activity</h3>
                        <p>The major economic activity undertaken in Uganda is Agriculture. This means that for many
                            families in Uganda, the source of income is agriculture.
                            In Uganda, the staple food is matooke( cooking bananas or plantain). Other food crops
                            include cassava (manioc), sweet potatoes, white potatoes, yams,
                            beans, peas, groundnuts (peanuts), cabbage, onions, pumpkins and tomatoes. Some fruits such
                            as oranges, pawpaws (papayas), lemons and pineapples,
                            are also grown.
